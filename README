Sparse notes on A/V Resources management.
-----------------------------------------

* Default dir for A/V files is /var/feng/avroot.
* Default RTSP port is 554.

* For every A/V resource you need
  
  1)  Either separate files for audio (MP3) and video (MPEG-1,2), or a
      libavformat compatible container (mov/mp4 suggested)
  2a) Optionally a Source Description (.sd) file for resource description
      to map the different sources.
  2b) Optionally an editlist (.ds for now) file that allows you to do a
      simple collage of resources. (the resources MUST be seekable)
  
  Streming clients must be invoked with, e.g:
  	
	$ streamingclient rtsp://streamingserver/content

  or similar.
  You can request plain files as you would expect from a webserver.

  The test files in avroot dir show a simple sd an ds and you can directly ask
  for the single audio and single video

* You can do live streaming in two ways:
 
 - (poor's man way) using a named-pipe:

  1) Create a named-pipe (e.g., mkfifo live.mp3),
  2) create a .sd file with the named-pipe as audio content, then
  3) feed named-pipe with live-encoded elementary stream data.

 - (warmly suggested way) using felix and shared memory:

  1) prepare a felix start script or just launch felix
  2) create a .sd file with the stream tags
  3) feed felix.

* Suggested encoding tools:
  Video: vlc, gst, ffmpeg
  Audio: vlc, gst, ffmpeg
