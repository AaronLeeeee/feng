Sparse notes on A/V Resources management.
-----------------------------------------

* Default dir for A/V files is /var/feng/avroot.
* Default RTSP port is 554.

* For every A/V resource you need
  
  1)  Either separate files for audio (MP3, Vorbis) and video (Theora, H264),
      or a libavformat compatible container (mov/mp4 suggested, ogg supported)
  2a) Optionally a Source Description (.sd) file for resource description
      to map the different sources.
  2b) Optionally an editlist (.ds for now) file that allows you to do a
      simple collage of resources. (the resources MUST be seekable)
  
  Streming clients must be invoked with, e.g:

	$ streamingclient rtsp://streamingserver/resource

  or similar.
  You can request plain files as you would expect from a webserver.

  Usage of sd files is severely discouraged.

* Suggested encoding tools:
  Video: vlc, gst, ffmpeg
  Audio: vlc, gst, ffmpeg
