The lscube team is proud to announce the first release of feng, the standard
streaming server. This is the first release so this notes won't be particulary
long, as stated in the README and in the website feng is a major improvement
over the Fenice codebase, most of the work was focused to have a robust
foundation and a flexible framework in order to provide a dependable solution
for common usage and remove any constraint for future development and research.
The main features currently implemented are the following:

 - very simple way to handle resources
 - the metademuxer compositor (ds)
 - support for recent codecs (h264, vorbis, theora)
 - support for mp3 basically because no clients but one* support vorbis.

*gstreamer cvs is the only implementation.
