    Release notes for feng 0.1.14


The lscube team is proud to announce the second release of feng, the standard
streaming server. The release notes will be quite terse, during this month we
focused on exposing some new features and polishing the previous code in order
to get rid of corner cases and race conditions.
From this release feng's bufferpool is a stand alone library in order to keep
the data structures in sync with felix, the multiplexer program used to feed
feng live streams.
The seeking facility that we used for the demuxer_ds now is exposed also in
the RTSP layer, issuing rtsp PAUSE+PLAY makes the server seek to the PLAY
argument, this feature obvisously would be enabled only for seekable streams,
for this release, anyway, it is restricted to demuxer_avf streams since
demuxer_ds requires some additional logic. 
From this release demuxer_sd provides experimental support for multicast with
the following constraints:
- the multicast address is per rtsp session, not per rtp stream
- every stream in the session must have the rtp port defined
