    Release notes for feng 0.1.99

Most of the invasive changes got already merged and are apparently stable
enough to grant a release. The most visible change is in the configuration,
that has been rewritten using lighttpd lemon based parser, the server now can
listen on an arbitrary number of sockets, the connection limits is really
configurable and some stale code got removed.
